Roadmap
#######

These are some of the things that I am thinking of adding in the near future. If you
have any other feature requests, please raise them using GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/issues>`_

- Custom utility functions, including risk aversion
- Plotting the efficient frontier.
- More optimisation goals, including the Calmar Ratio, Sortino Ratio, etc.
- Monte Carlo optimisation with custom distributions
- Black-Litterman portfolio selection
- Open-source backtests using either `Backtrader <https://www.backtrader.com/>`_ or
  `Zipline <https://github.com/quantopian/zipline>`_.
- Genetic optimisation methods (tentative)
- Further support for different risk/return models
